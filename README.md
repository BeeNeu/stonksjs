## BEWARE! WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is still work in progress and very, very subject to change. This is by no means
production ready, and shouldn't really be used by anyone but me right now.

## Installation

```bash
npm install stonksjs
```

or

```bash
yarn add stonksjs
```

## Usage

Again, still work in progress. So there isn't any usage.
